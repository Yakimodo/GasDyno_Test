To begin, we have the euler equations in 1D Cartesian (Completed)

(I) 5 unknowns (mass density, velocity, pressure, energy density, and temperature) ==> 5 equations:

      (a) 1. Continuity 2. Momentum 3. Energy Density 4. Temperature-Energy relation 5. Pressure-Temperature relations
      

We will move to cylindrical coordinates in 2D (In Process)
Then add to the streamer Code (Not yet)
